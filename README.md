BalloonGame
==================

BalloonGame is a 3rd person OpenGL game made as part of a university course 
assignment in Computer Graphics.

Description
-----------

You control a hot air balloon and try to avoid the floating skeletons and 
rocks and get to the treasure chest. You use WASDEQ keys to navigate in 3D 
space and Space to shoot down your enemies.

Rules
-----


* The hot air balloon cannot collide with any of the enemies
* The hot air balloon cannot be hit by enemy fire (the rock shaped enemies
start firing when you are close enough)
* You can fire at the enemies. When you hit a skeleton it dies and when you hit
a rock shaped enemy it gets disoriented and stops turning for a short amount
of time.
* The green donut shaped objects floating in the game are power ups (providing
either extra speed for a short amount of time or a 100 point bonus)
* It has two stages for testing loaded from stage1.txt and stage2.txt
